<h1>The Best Movies According to Mary Lou</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<ul>
<h3>The Fiddler On the Roof</h3>
<p>I loved the music and the dancing in this movie. I also loved learning about the Jewish traditions
    and the family connections. Tevye was a great narrator and he loves his family. He has to deal
    with the changing times. But, oh so sad in the end.

<h3>Interview with a Vampire</h3>
<p>I'm a big Anne Rice fan. I find this romantic fantasy about immortality at a price to be intriguing. I 
    especially like the New Orleans background.</p>
<h3>There's Something About Mary</h3>
<p>This movie has many memorable moments. I laughed so many times the first time I saw it. There are scenes
    that I'll always remember.
